* Test for proteins with many chains and different domains in the same chain
* Test for proteins not present in Chembl or without domain in Pfam
* Check if I can directly download the target proteins that have a crystal on pdb so computation time is reduced
* Time how long it takes to create the database for different numbers of proteins and estimate how long it would take it to do all of PDB
