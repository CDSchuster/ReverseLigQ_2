## TESTS

* Ligand-domain interactions scenarios:
  * One domain in one chain
  * One domain formed by two chains
  * Two domains in one chain
  * Two domains in different chains

## FUNCTIONALITY

* Retry failed SMILE requests
* Retry failed interactions request
* Recover data failed to request by loading it from PDB files
* Include Chembl data
* Filter those interactions that are not with residues (some are with solvent)
