# RevLigQ 2.0

## TESTS

* Ligand-domain interactions scenarios:
  * One domain in one chain
  * One domain formed by two chains
  * Two domains in one chain
  * Two domains in different chains

## FUNCTIONALITY

* Get ligand interactions
* Recover data failed to request by loading it from PDB files
* Determine ligand-domain interactions
* Include Chembl data

## ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES

* Get all data from PDB files instead of requesting it

## BUGS
