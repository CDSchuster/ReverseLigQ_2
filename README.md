## About

This tool is designed to search for proteins that could potentially bind a ligand provided by the user. ReverseLigQ_2 determines the query ligand potential protein targets by comparing it with thousands of other ligands whose targets are empirically known.

## Features

- Ligand comparison through two possible strategies:

    1. Ligand representation with Morgan fingerprints and comparison using Tanimoto method
    2. Ligand representation with molecular embeddings and comparison using an artificial neural network (ANN)

- Large ligand-protein interactions database to search generated from ChEMBL and PDB data

- Query a list of user-provided proteins for potential targets for the query ligand
