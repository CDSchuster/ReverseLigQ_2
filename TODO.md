# RevLigQ 2.0

## TESTS

* Ligand-domain interactions scenarios:
  * One domain in one chain
  * One domain formed by two chains
  * Two domains in one chain
  * Two domains in different chains

## FUNCTIONALITY

### DECOY GENERATION

* After clustering PDB smiles, filter property table and interaction table
* Adjust code to find decoys for each final representative SMILE from PDB

### DATABASE GENERATION

* Why the unrecoverable ligand and pfam data does not cause trouble when creating the dataframes
* Recover data failed to request by loading it from PDB files
* Include Chembl data
